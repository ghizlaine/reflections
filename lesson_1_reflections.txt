1.hello, my name is Ghizlaine
The diff commande is very interesting
as it doesn't let u spend a lot of time
reading your code line by line

2.It is very efficient as you always have efficient versions 
of your file saved properly

3. the pros of commiting manually is that you judge effectively 
when it is a good time to do it. 
This way you make sure that you're commit has one clear
logical purpose in order to not clutter your history

4. git log opens the repositroy in order to check all the commmits
and the changes that were made into it
git diff compares a file between 2 commits showing which line have been modified
and which one has not
