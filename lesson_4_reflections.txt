When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local work?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To make sure you commit at the right moment when it makes a logical sense in your changes and when you are ready to share your work with other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you useone instead of another?

Forks are a copy of someone else's repository directly on your github. forks arejust like a cloning that github makes for you on their own machine

clones are a copy of a repository from github to your local machine/ from your local machine to your local machine/ or from your local machine to github

Branches are in the same repository and represent labels for your commits.
