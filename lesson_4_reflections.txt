When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local work?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To make sure you commit at the right moment when it makes a logical sense in your changes and when you are ready to share your work with other people.
